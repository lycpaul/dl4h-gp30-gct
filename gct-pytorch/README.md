# Graph Convolutional Transformer in pytorch

The following gct-pytorch implementation mostly adopted from the [dchang56/gct-pytorch](https://github.com/dchang56/gct-pytorch) with slight modifications to fit our project purpose. Output of the training results is also provided for reference.

Viewing the result with Tensorboard
```shell
tensorboard --logdir=eicu_output/model_0.00022_0.08_readmission
